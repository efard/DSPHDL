# DSPHDL

# Introduction
The aim of this project is using VHDL for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications. In this repo, we will learn how to generate some prevalent modulations. You can download the whole project from repository and try your desired setting (e.g. output frequency, bitwidth, etc.).
# Prerequisites
Xilinx ISE software
ModelSim SE software
# Outputs
By running BPSK project, you will see the results similar to Fig.1
